## 🔥 Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Firebase Integration Issues (HIGH PRIORITY)

#### Issue: Stream Memory Leaks

**Location**: `lib/screens/ui/search.dart:105-114`
**Problem**: Firestore streams not properly cancelled on widget dispose
**Impact**: Memory leaks, battery drain, potential app crashes
**Solution**: Implemented proper StreamSubscription management

```dart
// Before: Stream not cancelled
final stream = searchRepository.searchExamPapers(...);
final newPapers = await stream.first;

// After: Proper stream management
_searchSubscription = stream.listen(
  (newPapers) { /* handle data */ },
  onError: (error) { /* handle error */ },
);
// Cancelled in dispose()
_searchSubscription?.cancel();
```

#### Issue: Multiple Firebase Instance Creation

**Location**: Multiple service files
**Problem**: 7+ instances of `FirebaseFirestore.instance` across services
**Impact**: Memory overhead, potential race conditions
**Solution**: Created centralized Firebase service

```dart
// New: lib/services/firebase_service.dart
class FirebaseService {
  static FirebaseService? _instance;
  static FirebaseService get instance => _instance ??= FirebaseService._();

  FirebaseFirestore get firestore => FirebaseFirestore.instance;
  FirebaseAuth get auth => FirebaseAuth.instance;
  FirebaseStorage get storage => FirebaseStorage.instance;
}
```

#### Issue: Missing Environment Variables

**Problem**: `.env` file not found, Cloudinary credentials missing
**Impact**: App crashes on Firebase operations
**Solution**: Created environment configuration template

### 2. Layout Overflow Issues (HIGH PRIORITY)

#### Issue: Fixed Height Image Containers

**Location**: `lib/screens/ui/search.dart:770-771`
**Problem**: Fixed height containers causing overflow on small screens
**Solution**: Implemented responsive AspectRatio containers

```dart
// Before: Fixed height causing overflow
SizedBox(
  height: 200,
  width: double.infinity,
  child: CachedNetworkImage(...)
)

// After: Responsive aspect ratio
AspectRatio(
  aspectRatio: 16 / 9,
  child: CachedNetworkImage(...)
)
```

#### Issue: Non-Responsive Grid Layout

**Location**: `lib/screens/ui/home.dart:109`
**Problem**: Fixed crossAxisCount causing overflow on smaller screens
**Solution**: Implemented responsive grid with LayoutBuilder

```dart
// Before: Fixed grid columns
GridView.count(
  crossAxisCount: 2,
  // ...
)

// After: Responsive grid
LayoutBuilder(
  builder: (context, constraints) {
    int crossAxisCount;
    if (constraints.maxWidth < 600) {
      crossAxisCount = 1; // Mobile: single column
    } else if (constraints.maxWidth < 900) {
      crossAxisCount = 2; // Tablet: two columns
    } else {
      crossAxisCount = 3; // Desktop: three columns
    }
    return GridView.count(crossAxisCount: crossAxisCount, ...);
  },
)
```

### 3. Deprecated API Usage (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

#### Issue: withOpacity Deprecation

**Location**: Multiple files (109 instances)
**Problem**: Using deprecated `withOpacity()` method
**Solution**: Updated to `withValues(alpha: value)`

```dart
// Before: Deprecated
Colors.black.withOpacity(0.08)

// After: Modern API
Colors.black.withValues(alpha: 0.08)
```
